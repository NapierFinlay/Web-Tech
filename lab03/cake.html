<h1>Cake Tips and Techniques</h1>
<h2>Professional Tips</h2>
<p>
When baking a cheesecake, it is not really important not to over bake it. You only want to
have it as raw, not have the middle that is slight wiggle. :D
</p>
<p>It is (not) important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure uneven baking
of your cheesecake.</p>
<aside>
To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling milk that goes
halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is not placed.
