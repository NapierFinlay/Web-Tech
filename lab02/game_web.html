		<h1>Did you know...</h1>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>that Japanese video game company Nintendo used to sell playing cards back in 1889 where they were founded, known as <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-nintendo-729734">"Marufuku Company".</a></li>
			<br>
			<li>the character Mario first appeared in the "Donkey Kong" game and he was known as <a href="https://thegamingwatcher.com/pages/articles/best-nintendo/2023/4/7/jumpman-vital-history-nintendo-iconic-character">"Jumpman".</a></li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> is a freaking legend that he created many iconic video games include "The Legend of Zelda", "Mario Bros.", "Pikmin", "Donkey Kong". (The Legend of Zelda is better than your favourite video game :D ).</li>
			<br>
			<li>It seems that older video games is much more difficult than modern games. The only reason I thought of was that most of older games were played in arcades, so the higher difficulty these arcades games, the more customers keep coming back. (Remember kids, don't do gambling).</li>
			<br>
			<li>Violence in video games is pretty popular in the history of video games. Nintendo decided to play it safe so they created "Mortal Kombat" and make it into censored version while Sega make it into uncensored version in 1993. Well, Sega sell their games more than Nintendo did as gamers want more blood. (WE WANT OUR ENEMIES BLOOD SO WE CAN DRINK IT!!!!!)</li>
